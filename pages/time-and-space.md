# Time and Space

## Time Frames

Passage of time is divided into different categories by activity.

During normal, moment-to-moment adventuring, time is not tracked. Traveling and resting occur in *watches*. Combat occurs in *rounds*.

### Watches

The day is divided into six watches, about four hours each.

| Watch | Time of day |
|-|-|
| Dawn | Twilight |
| Morning | Daylight |
| Afternoon | Daylight |
| Dusk | Twilight |
| First watch | Night |
| Second watch | Night |

Businesses, like smiths, armorers and temples generally operate during twilight and daylight hours.

Traveling from a location to another takes a number of watches. A two day journey takes twelve watches, and starts and ends during the same watch, e.g. Dawn.

Normal adventuring occurs during a single watch, i.e. time does not progress into the next watch, until the players travel overland, take a rest or make camp.

### Rest

Whenever the player party wants, they can take a *rest*. A rest takes a single watch.

During a rest, each character heals one point of Stamina, and may take one of the following actions:

- [Field repair](characters#list-of-skills) a piece of equipment
- [Stabilize](characters#list-of-skills) a bleeding character
- Re-memorize a new set of spells or prayers
- Change [equipment loadout](equipment#equipment-slots)

> A rest consists of finding a suitable resting place, personal maintenance, field tasks and resting with one eye open.

### Camp

Just like rest, *camp* can be taken any time. A camp takes three watches.

During a camp, each character heals all their Stamina, and may take one of the following actions:

- [Field repair](characters#list-of-skills) up to four pieces of equipment
- Use [Trauma treatment](characters#list-of-skills) to treat a critical wound
- Re-memorize a new set of spells or prayers
- Change [equipment loadout](equipment#equipment-slots)

> A camp consists of finding a suitable camp ground and preparing it, setting campfires, personal maintenance, medical and field tasks, sleeping and watch duty.

## Space aka Maps

Space, or maps, feature overland and local locations.

### Overland Maps

Traveling from location to another occurs on overland maps. Such maps can represent a very large area, such as a continent, or a relatively small area, like a mountain valley.

An overland map consists of *places of interest*, or PoIs, and *connections*, which link them.

A place of interest can be for example a city or a village, a hillside containing a warren of underground tunnels, a military camp or fort, a traders' caravan etc.

A connection lists the time, in watches, it takes to travel, and other features of the journey, such as the difficulty of the traversed terrain and possible dangers lurking in wait for travelers.

Overland maps do not need to represent actual physical relative locations of places of interest, which can be though to be only practically reachable by the given connections.

TODO Random encounters, blocked passage, resting

### Local Maps

A local map is a tactical map that represents a location where moment-to-moment adventuring and combat occur.

A local map consists of *areas* and *connections*. Local maps are integrally tied in with combat rules.

#### Local Areas

An area is a space, such as a courtyard, a floor in a fortress tower, a garden, or a large balcony, that can be traversed in a single combat round.

A Sneaking check covers traversing a single area.

Melee skirmish, as well as thrown weapon ranged attacks occur within a single area.

Marksman ranged attacks occur within an area and *adjacent* areas, which are areas that are linked by a connection, provided that there is line of sight.

A local area specification can feature things such as:

- Treasure
- Traps and natural perils
- Items, weapons and armor
- NPCs, such as monsters, guards etc
- Hidden or difficult to spot clues and objects

#### Local Connections

A local connection is a link between two areas.

It can represent a normally traversable passage, such as a doorway, a narrow hall, or simply a dividing point of a larger area, such as a garden.

It can also represent a more difficult passage, such as a perilous climb or a small crevice, through which a nimble character might fit through with some acrobatic skill.

Or, it could indicate a visual-only connection, such as a heavy portcullis, through which ranged weapons could be projected, but which cannot be traversed at least by non-magical means.

A connection specification can feature things such as:

- Whether the connection is traversable
- How difficult it is to notice the link, if hidden
- How difficult it is to traverse the link, if it requires a skill check
- Whether a link is bidirectional, or one-way, such as a drop

#### Zone of Control

A character has a *zone of control* in the area they occupy.

This means that other characters cannot traverse the area without engaging in melee combat with that character, if the controlling character wishes to block their passage.

To forcibly traverse a zone of control, a character must engage the controlling character. Then, they must succeed in [Disengaging](combat#engagement-and-disengaging) from combat to continue through the area.
