# Wealth

There is no single currency in the world of Paraverse after the Scattering.

Jewels, precious metals, spices and salt and magical and divine baubles are the mediums of exchange.

Every trade is a busy affair of valuation, bargaining and trade-offs, where the skill of the merchant counts for as much as the currency.

## Wealth Level

Wealth is not tracked by individual character but rather by the group as a whole.

Individual assets are abstracted into the concept of *wealth level*.

### Wealth Level Effects

| Level | Effects |
|-:|-|
| 0 | Group is broke, and cannot make purchases. Sleep on streets in urban areas. Most people have [unfriendly disposition](characters#npc-disposition). |
| 1&ndash;5 | Slovenly looks. Rent space in stables and leaky attics in urban areas. Guards, merchants and high society may have [unfriendly disposition](characters#npc-disposition). |
| 6&ndash;10 | Plain looks. Rent space in boarding houses in urban areas. High society may have [unfriendly disposition](characters#npc-disposition). |
| 11&ndash;15 | Comfortable looks. Rent private rooms in reputable inns. |
| 16+ | Fashionable looks. Rent private suites in luxurious inns or manors. |

## Trading

Trading occurs by using the [Mercantile](characters#list-of-skills) skill.

The target difficulty level `T` depends on the qualities of the item to be purchased.

To perform a purchase skill check, roll `d20` and add your Mercantile skill modifier `S` and group wealth level `W`. Partial failure and failure are as described in the list of skills.

A successful check indicates that you successfully purchase the item. All item purchases reduce the group's wealth level by one, unless otherwise specified.

A group with wealth level zero is broke and cannot make purchases.

### Trading Target Difficulties

For items other than weapons, shields and armor, the target difficulty is set by the Game Master.

The base trading target difficulty level for a piece of equipment, i.e. a weapon, shield or armor, is `10`.

- For each point of [durability](equipment#durability-and-disrepair) above `10`, add `1` to the target level, up to 15. Only Mastercrafted equipment has durability over 15.
- For one-handed and ranged weapons, add the weapon base damage.
- For two-handed weapons, add the weapon base damage minus `5`.
- For shields, add the Shield Value times `3`.
- For armor, add the Armor Value.

For equipment with [special traits](equipment#quipment-special-traits), futher multipliers are cumulatively (multiplicatively) added. Note that the cultural special traits (Elven, Dwarven, Gnomish) are mutually exclusive.

- Mastercrafted equipment has target value `+2` for each point of durability above 15.
- Elven equipment has target value multiplier `1.3`.
- Dwarven equipment has target value multiplier `1.3`.
- Gnomish equipment has target value multiplier `1.5`.
- Enchanted equipment has target value multiplier `1.5`.

The final trading target difficulty value is obtained by applying the multiplier and rounding normally.

> **Example**
>
> A Dwarven broadsword (base damage 7) with durability 15 is offered for sale by a well-stocked merchant as a special purchase. The trading target difficulty value for purchasing this item is (10 + 5 + 7) Ã— 1.3, which rounds to 29.

## Attrition

At the end of every session that the player character group did not gain more wealth, the group's wealth level is reduced by one, to a minimum of zero.

## Collecting Junk

Junk picked up from the battlefield is not worth its weight, other than to replace a sword or hammer, which may be dangerously worn out.

Merchants do not usually buy mundane things from adventurers.
