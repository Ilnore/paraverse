## Divinity and Divine Prayer

Anyone who has accepted the Divine to their heart is a Faithful. It is only necessary to pledge your soul to a Deity.

The Faithful of the Divine express their faith through piety and fervent prayers to their Deities, so that they might grant them Divine power at their hour of need. Prayer can take the form of a quick litany or that of a complex ritual. Further, the distilling and consecrating of *cordials* is practised.

While many claim to have done so, the Deities do not speak to mortals, and their will is perceived only indirectly through so-called *precepts*. No one knows exactly how this happens, but upon waking from slumber, the Faithful seem to possess absolute certainty of how they should conduct themselves.

### Precepts

A true Faithful walks a difficult path, where mortal needs and desires must be tempered by the will of the Divine.

A Faithful is always under a precept. Upon taking a [camp](time-and-space#camp), roll a `d20`. If the result is `11-20`, you receive a new, random precept. If the character prays for changing the precept, this roll has [advantage](characters#advantage-and-disadvantage).

| Precept | Obligations |
|-|-|
| Rancor | Walk among the heathen with fire and sword. Always choose the more severe and harsh judgment. |

### Favor and Disfavor

Whenever a Faithful acts upon a precept, whether honoring its obligations or either neglecting or even contravening them, they gain Favor or Disfavor.

A Faithful is not absolutely beholden to the precepts &mdash; they may choose to act according to their own judgment and morals instead.

However, if there is one thing the Deities do not tolerate, it appears to be Arcane magic. Whenever a Faithful casts an Arcane spell, they gain Disfavor.

### Oblivious Deities

At the end of each session, one Favor is forgotten by the deities, while Disfavor is not.

### Divine Prayer

There are two levels of zeal of prayers, *Pious* and *Fervent* prayer.

A Pious prayer is one where the supplicant offers their worship for a lesser favor from their Deity. Pious prayers have a target difficulty value.

A Fervent prayer is when the supplicant calls Divine Judgment upon themselves in recognition of their deeds and to grant a greater favor. Whatever the outcome, a Fervent prayer resets the accrued Favor and Disfavor.

#### Pious Prayer Resolution

To utter a divine prayer, you must first have memorized it.

Let `T` be a prayer's target difficulty and `S` your skill in divine prayer. To be able to attempt to utter this prayer, `T` must be *equal to or less than* `S + 10`.

Roll `d20` and add `S`. If the result is *greater than* `T`, the prayer has been Favored. Otherwise, the prayer has been Disfavored, and must roll `d10` on the prayer disfavor table, modified by `T - S - 10` (minimum modifier value is zero).

A natural `20` is Favored and natural `1` is Disfavored.

#### Fervent Prayer Resolution

Let Favor value `F` be twice the number of accrued Favors, and Disfavor value `D` be twice the number of accrued Disfavors.

If `F + D` is *greater than* `20`, then redefine `F` to be `20 - D`. Intuitively this means that Favors cannot cancel out Disfavors, while the opposite can happen.

Roll `d20` and let `R` be the result. Then, if `R` is *greater than* `20 - F` (in the top `F` possible die results), the prayer is Favored. If `R` is *less than or equal* to `D`, the prayer is Disfavored. Otherwise, the prayer is ignored.

When a Fervent prayer is Disfavored, you must roll `d12 + D` on the prayer disfavor table.

Whatever the outcome, accrued Favor and Disfavor are reset.

> **Example**
>
> A character has accrued three Favors and one Disfavor. Hence the Favor value is 2 × 3 = 6 and Disfavor value is 2 × 1 = 2. The die roll result is 14, and the prayer is unfortunately ignored. If the roll value had been just one higher, the prayer would have been Favored (15 > 20 - 6).

#### Prayer Disfavor

| Roll | Result |
|-:|-|
| 1&ndash;10 | Prayer is ignored without further effect. |
| 11 | Supplicant suffers 1 pain. |
| 12 | Supplicant suffers 2 pain. |
| 13 | Supplicant suffers 1 pain and starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects). |
| 14 | Supplicant is [incapacitated](combat#incapacitation) and starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects). |
| 15 | Supplicant is [incapacitated](combat#incapacitation), starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects) and permanently loses `1` WIL. |
| 16&ndash;18 | Supplicant is instantly killed (lost `1` WIL if resurrected). |
| 19&ndash;20 | Supplicant is instantly killed, and their body is burned to cinder. |
