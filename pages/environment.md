# Environment

## Ambushes

When a character or group of characters is attacked by another character they are not aware of, they are *ambushed*.

On the first round of combat, ambushed characters have disadvantage on their combat rolls &mdash; ranged attacks, melee skirmishing and evasion.

Player characters may get ambushed while adventuring, or while resting or making camp. In such cases, an [Awareness](charaters#list-of-skills) check, [opposed](characters#opposed-skill-resolution) by an attacker's [Sneaking](charaters#list-of-skills) skill, should be afforded to the most perceptive player character. If that check succeeds, the attack does not count as an ambush.

## Climbing, Jumping and Falling

Sometimes moving from an [area](time-and-space#local-areas) to another requires traversing a [connection](time-and-space#local-connections) which requires an [Acrobatics](characters#list-of-skills) (climbing/scaling) check.

A significant climb can consist of multiple *legs*. In such cases, each connection requires a separate skill check, and represents a measure of distance a character will fall on a failed skill check.

Or, a connection may require an [Athletics](characters#list-of-skills) (jumping) check, for example to leap across a chasm. Failing the jump check means a plunge to the bottom of the pit. An enclosed pit would then necessitate a tedious climb back up!

If a character falls, they will suffer `2d6` points of Impact damage per leg, to a [hit location](combat#hit-location) determined as usual. Damage is converted into [pain](combat#pain-resolution) and [critical wounds](combat#critical-wounds-resolution) as normal. A fall may also necessitate a [disrepair](equipment#durability-and-disrepair) check on worn armor.

Notice the effects of [armor](equipment#armor-weight-classes) and [critical wounds](combat#critical-wound-effects) on physical activities.

## Swimming, Diving and Drowning

Sometimes moving from an [area](time-and-space#local-areas) to another requires traversing a [connection](time-and-space#local-connections) which requires an [Athletics](characters#list-of-skills) (swimming/diving) check.

Swimming requires a check only if the body of water has a current or eddies, or is otherwise treacherous, or the swim is considerable in length.

A significant swim/dive can consist of multiple *legs*. In such cases, each connection requires a separate skill check, and represents a measure of distance a character must swim/dive back, unless a shorter route lies ahead.

If a character fails a swim/dive skill check, they become panicked and start *drowning*.

A drowning character takes `2d6` Drowning damage per round they are in the water, until at zero Stamina, at which point they become [incapacitated](combat#incapacitation). Damage is converted to [pain/fatigue](combat#pain-resolution) as usual, but armor or shields do not mitigate the damage. Critical wounds are not sustained.

Drowning charcaters have [disadvantage](characters#advantage-and-disadvantage) to all skill checks, including swimming/diving back to solid ground.

A character who is incapacitated in water for five rounds dies of drowning.

Another character, who is not drowning, and who is in the same [area](time-and-space#local-areas) may *assist* a drowning character. The drowning character will still take Drowning damage each round, but does not need to make skill checks to move.

Notice the effects of [armor](equipment#armor-weight-classes) and [critical wounds](combat#critical-wound-effects) on physical activities.

## Chasing, Catching and Escaping

Chasing occurs when one character tries to catch another character, who is trying to get away.

Chasing is resolved via an [opposed](characters#opposed-skill-resolution) [Athletics](characters#list-of-skills) versus Athletics skill check.

To catch or escape the other character, two consecutive checks need to be won. An escaping character affords the chaser *one* [Throwing](characters#list-of-skills), or *two* [Marksman](characters#list-of-skills) [ranged attacks](combat#ranged-attack-resolution), but each counts as a won chase check for the evading character.

Notice the effects of [armor](equipment#armor-weight-classes) and [critical wounds](combat#critical-wound-effects) on physical activities.

## Cities and Villages

Urban and suburban centers come in many flavors, from bustling port cities, austere military forts and subsisting frontier hamlets to subterranean Dwarven mining colonies and Elven tree gardens.

In some places it may be illegal to loiter, or to sleep outside.

Visiting a service or a point of interest takes one [watch](time-and-space#watches).

The existence and level of a service may depend on the size, prosperity and nature of the settlement.

### Standardized Services

Some services are so commonly offered they have become standardized.

#### Taverns and Inns

Taverns, inns and boarding houses are places that offer warm food, cold drink, gossip and news and a sheltered place to turn in for the night. Wealthier individuals may even choose to lodge at a local manor, where the concerns of the higher society may be overheard.

- Taverns can be visited to use Social [Interaction](characters#list-of-skills) skills to obtain information, usually of the lower social classes.
- Boarding houses (or in a pinch, stables) offer modest accommodation off the streets
- Inns offer private rooms. A [camp](time-and-space#camp) taken at an inn only takes two [watches](time-and-space#watches). Staying at an inn reduces the group's [wealth level](wealth#wealth-level) by one point.
- Manors offer private rooms. A [camp](time-and-space#camp) taken at a manor only takes two [watches](time-and-space#watches). Social [Interaction](characters#list-of-skills) skills may be used to obtain information, usually of the higher social classes. Staying at a manor reduces the group's [wealth level](wealth#wealth-level) by one point.

See [wealth level](wealth#wealth-level) for information on cost of accommodation. Sleeping on the streets may be illegal or dangerous.

#### Gambling Dens

Gambling dens, or sometimes ordinary taverns or even street games offer the chance to put your luck and coin to the test. Local hoodlums and ruffians frequent these locales.

- Street games allow a betting pool of `1` wealth level
- Tavern tourneys allow a betting pool of `2` wealth levels
- Gambling dens allow a betting pool of `5` wealth levels

Gambling occurs normally by a simple `d20` roll, with a `12+` result winning the bet, and a lower result losing the bet. Some [abilities](characters#abilities) may change this, but losing a bet without being able to pay is always a recipe for trouble.

#### Smiths and Armorers

Smiths and armorers offer weapons, shields and armor for sale, as well as provide repair services.

- Have a piece of equipment in [disrepair](equipment#durability-and-disrepair) repaired by a smith. Requires a [Mercantile](characters#list-of-skills) check with a target difficulty value *half* of item [sales target difficulty](wealth#trading-target-difficulties). Multiple pieces can be repaired at a single visit, but each requires separate check.
- Peruse items for a rare find. Roll according to [Trader Level](equipment#trader-level) and refer to the [perusing finds table](equipment#perusing-at-a-store). Only one peruse roll can be performed per visit.
- Purchase an item of a specific kind. Roll according to [Trader Level](equipment#trader-level) and refer to the [specific item table](equipment#purchase-item-of-specific-kind). Separate specific item rolls can be performed for the following item categories per visit, unless each generated item is purchased.
    - One-handed weapons
    - Two-handed weapons
    - Thrown weapons
    - Marksman weapons
    - Shields
    - Armor

> **Example**
>
> A character visits a smith and inquires about purchasing a broadsword. The generated item has too low durability to interest the character.
>
> Since broadsword is categorized as a one-handed weapon, the character cannot attempt to roll up a different one-handed weapon, e.g. a war axe. However, if the broadsword is purchased, then another one-handed item can be generated.
>
> In either case, a piece of equipment in a different category can be rolled up.

#### Alchemists

|-|-|
| Incense | 10 |
| Myrrh | 20 |

#### Monasteries

Monasteries offer healing and divinely restorative services to travelers who are missing limbs, or even resurrection, if a corpse and some coin is procured.

Divine acts of restoration and resurrection are not exclusive to the rich &mdash; they simply cost *all* of your [wealth](wealth#wealth-level) &mdash; but you must first conclude a small negotiation.

- Healing at a temple or monastery is free. Full [stamina](characters#secondary-stats) and all [critical wounds](combat#critical-wound-effects) are healed, in one or two [watches](time-and-space#watches), respectively.
- Restoration of a single limb requires a [Mercantile](characters#list-of-skills) check with a target difficulty value `15`. The missing limb is not necessary.
- Resurrection requires a [Mercantile](characters#list-of-skills) check with a target difficulty value `20`. The dead character's corpse is required. Multiple characters from the player group can be bundled into one deal. Resurrection may come with the catch of becoming a devout follower of the local deity.
