# Arcane and Divine

The Arcane and Divine are supernatural powers whose origins are shrouded in mystery.

The Arcane arts take a more scientific, direct approach to manipulating these forces. Divinity is a more spiritual approach, whose proponents believe that all magical force derives from Deities who grant power to those who are deemed worthy through unwavering faith and worship.

In any case, great exertion of willpower is necessary for both spellcasting and divine prayer. Some arcanists even purport this as evidence that priests and monks of the divine faiths are actually channeling arcane power, just like sorcerers. Such claims, naturally, are condemned by the faithful as heretical ravings.

The more esoteric magical realms of Druidism, Dwarven Runecrafting and Gnomish Artifice, are usually grouped with the Arcane arts, although they are not strictly appropriate.

## Memorizing Spells and Prayers

Before spells can be casted or prayers recited, they must be memorized. A character whose [Memory](characters#secondary-stats) secondary stat value is `M` can memorize equally many spells or prayers.

Memorizing a new set of spells or prayers can be done during a [rest](time-and-space#rest) or [camp](time-and-space#camp).

## Sustained Spells and Prayers

A spell or prayer whose Duration is *Sustained(X)*, must be sustained for the spell or prayer to remain in effect. A character whose [Sustain](characters#secondary-stats) is `S` can sustain a total of equally many sustain points `X`.

Sustained spells need to be recast after a [camp](time-and-space#camp).

> **Example**
>
> A character's Sustain value is 4. They could sustain spells with Sustained(1) and Sustained(2), and still have 1 sustain point (4 - 1 - 2 = 1) available for another sustained spell.

## Non-Combat Spells and Prayers

*Non-Combat* spells and prayers cannot be cast in combat, since they require some time and preparation. Unlike *Rituals* though, they won't progress the watch.

## Ritual Spells and Prayers

A spell or prayer with the *Ritual* keyword require a more complex ritual cast or recital. Such spells or prayers take one [watch](time-and-space#watches) to cast or recite.

## Concentrating on a Spell or Prayer

Some spells or prayers have duration marked as Concentration. These spells or prayers remain in effect while the caster is actively concentrating.

Taking a skill check other than Evasion, suffering pain or a critical wound or becoming incapacitated breaks concentration. Only one spell or prayer can be concentrated on at a time.

## Spell and Prayer Saves

A spell or a prayer may grant a save check to the target of the spell or prayer. The save check has a governing stat, e.g. Physique, whose modifier (stat value minus 10) is `S`. The caster's Willpower modifier is `W`.

The save is resolved as `d20 + S - W`. If the result is *greater than* 10, the save is successful. Otherwise the save has failed.
