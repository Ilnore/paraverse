# Arcana and Spellcasting

An Arcane sorcerer reaches with his mind to the Source and draws arcane power through raw willpower, bending the fabric of the universe to their will. A druid draws on the power of untamed nature through the mind's eye or blood rituals. Dwarven runesmiths craft runes from alchemical reagents, shaped to secret words of power branded onto weapons and armor. Gnomish artificers build mechanical constructs and imbue them with magic.

To become an arcanist, no formal education is necessary, although it can be beneficial. It simply suffices to unlock one of the Aspects, or Schools, of Arcane magic. But beware, for the flow of magic is treacherous, and will burn the careless dabbler to cinder in the blink of an eye.

## Spellcasting Resolution

To cast a spell, you must first have memorized it.

Let `T` be a spell's target difficulty and `S` your skill in that spell's aspect. To be able to attempt to cast this spell, `T` must be *equal to or less than* `S + 10`.

Roll `d20` and add `S`. If the result is *greater than* `T`, you will have successfully cast the spell. Otherwise, you have failed in casting the spell, and must roll `d10` on the spell failure table, modified by `T - S - 10` (minimum modifier value is zero).

A natural `20` is a success and natural `1` is a failure.

### Spell Failure

| Roll | Result |
|-:|-|
| 1&ndash;10 | Spell fails without further effect. |
| 11 | Caster suffers 1 pain. |
| 12 | Caster suffers 2 pain. |
| 13 | Caster suffers 2 pain and starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects). |
| 14 | Caster is [incapacitated](combat#incapacitation) and starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects). |
| 15 | Caster is [incapacitated](combat#incapacitation), starts [bleeding](combat#critical-wound-effects) and permanently loses `1` WIL. |
| 16&ndash;18 | Caster is instantly killed (lost `1` WIL if resurrected). |
| 19&ndash;20 | Caster is instantly killed, and their body is burned to cinder. |

## Evocation

## Druidism

Druidism draws power from the living force of untamed nature through herbs, rituals and blood magic. Nature manifests not as a gentle nurturer, but as a brutal contest for survival, fitness and fertility.

### Biome Power Level

Druidic magic waxes and wanes in power with the verdancy of the local biome. Each Place of Interest's verdancy is determined by the Game Master. The resulting Biome Power Level is referenced as `BPL` in the spell descriptions.

| Verdancy | BPL |
|-|-|
| Barren | 0 |
| Stunted | 1 |
| Verdant | 3 |
| Lush | 5 |

### Blood Magic

Blood magic changes its nature by the blood used. Blood freely given yields more stable magic, while blood forcibly taken produces more powerful, unpredictable results.

Blood can be harvested from any bleeding or slain creature that has blood (Blood Forcibly Taken), or volunteered by any player character at the cost of `1` point of Stamina (Blood Willingly Given).

## Runecraft

Deep in their mountainside fortresses, the Dwarves have long devised their secret language. Runes written in this language, when branded on steel using alchemical means, gives weapons, shields and armor special powers and qualities.

Since the Dwarves will not reveal the secrets of these runes to outsiders, generally only Dwarf characters may unlock the Runecraft Aspect.

Each piece of equipment (weapon, shield or armor) may only have one rune branded onto it at a time, unless otherwise specified.

| Difficulty | 18 |
| Target | Any surface |
| Duration | Permanent, until triggered |

## Artifice

Artifice is the Gnomish art of producing magically imbued artifacts of exceedingly finely crafted mechanical inner workings. No other races can match the clockwork precision required to make these constructs, thus generally only Gnome characters may unlock the Artifice Aspect.

### Golem Construction

The construction of true golems is a deeply involved art and science, which even few Gnomes master. Instead, mechanically and magically gifted Gnomish adventurers find much more utility in so-called *mini-golems*, which are [constructs](combat#constructs) the size of a buckler shield and come in several varieties.

A mini-golem consists of a metallic alloy *chassis*, or frame, and any number of *modules* which give the golem capabilities beyond its basic logic functions.

To construct a chassis, the [Traps/devices](characters#list-of-skills) skill is used in conjunction with *alloys* determined by the desired chassis properties, including module slots.

#### Hexapod Chassis

Hexapod golems move on the ground and can climb and jump. They have [Athletics](characters#list-of-skills) 5 and [Evasion](characters#list-of-skills) 5. Their Armor Value (AV) and Structural points (S) depend on the construction as follows.

| Alloys | Slots (M) | AV/S | Durab. | Diff. |
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Metal (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;3 | 10/50 | 12 | `14 + M` |
| Dwarven (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;3 | 13/80 | 15 | `16 + M` |
| Gnomish (`1 + M`) | 4&ndash;6 | 10/100 | 12 | `18 + M` |
| Gnomish (`M`), Dwarven (`3`) | 4&ndash;6 | 15/150 | 15 | `20 + M` |

#### Aquatic Chassis

Aquatic golems move in water and perform Athletics (swim) checks only in very difficult conditions. They have [Athletics](characters#list-of-skills) 10 and [Evasion](characters#list-of-skills) 7. Their Armor Value (AV) and Structural points (S) depend on the construction as follows.

| Alloys | Slots (M) | AV/S | Durab | Diff |
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Metal (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;3 | 10/40 | 12 | `14 + M` |
| Dwarven (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;3 | 13/65 | 15 | `16 + M` |
| Gnomish (`1 + M`) | 4&ndash;6 | 10/80 | 12 | `18 + M` |
| Gnomish (`M`), Dwarven (`3`) | 4&ndash;6 | 15/120 | 15 | `20 + M` |

#### Aerial Chassis

Aerial golems use four mechanical wings to become airborne, and can maneuver at a low altitude. They have [Evasion](characters#list-of-skills) 10. Their Armor Value (AV) and Structural points (S) depend on the construction as follows.

| Alloys | Slots (M) | AV/S | Durab | Diff |
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Metal (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;2 | 6/30 | 12 | `14 + M` |
| Dwarven (`1 + M`) | 1&ndash;2 | 9/40 | 15 | `16 + M` |
| Gnomish (`1 + M`) | 3&ndash;4 | 6/55 | 12 | `18 + M` |
| Gnomish (`M`), Dwarven (`3`) | 3&ndash;4 | 9/80 | 15 | `20 + M` |

#### Modules

Modules are constructed using the Artifice skill and alchemical reagents required.

| Module | Reagents | Function | Diff |
|-|-|-|-:|
| Telepathic Vision | 1 Sulfur | Allows the operator to telepathically see through the module. Controlling the golem in combat through the module is an action. | 17 |
| Manipulators | 1 Salt | Enables the golem to open unlocked doors, windows, carry small objects, pull rope etc. | 15 |
| Hardened Armor | 1 Salt | Increase golem's Armor Value by 50%. | 15 |
| Coalescing Lens Array | 1 Sulfur | Store a single Arcane spell. The artificer must cast the spell into the module. The module can then attempt to cast the spell using skill modifier `S`. A failed spell cast attempt renders the module inoperable, until it has received basic maintenance. | `12 + S` |
| Static Resonator | 1 Mercury | Provides the golem 1 Sustain point. | 20 |
| Enhanced Logic Unit | 1 Sulfur | Enables conditional and more complex instructions to the golem. | 16 |

### Golem Operation

A mini-golem can be carried in the sidearm equipment slot.

A golem can be given a set of simple instructions &mdash; guard this area, follow me, destroy enemies, protect a target &mdash; which the golem will then execute. Golems equipped with Telepathic Vision can also be directly controlled.

After each operation, a durability check needs to be made on the chassis.

Structural damage can be repaired using one unit of the alloy most used in the chassis and a [Field repair](characters#list-of-skills) check during a [rest](time-and-space#rest).

### Talismans

Talismans are small artifacts that have various purposes.

| Talisman | Reagents | Description | Diff |
|-|-|-|
| Mana Well | X Sulfur | Store `X` points of latent Arcane energy, to a maximum of `3`. The bearer of a Mana Well can consume the well when casting a spell to gain `+X` to the skill check. Only one well can be consumed per spell cast. | `12 + 4X` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
