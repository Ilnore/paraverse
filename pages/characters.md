## Player Character Races

### Men

Men are a diverse and populous race, who &mdash; despite their average racial traits &mdash; have reached a dominant position in many of the presently habitable lands.

#### Scythians

The Scythian people comprise multiple cultures from the coastal raiders of the north, the nomads of the eastern steppes to the desert tribes of the southern wastelands. Druidic and wild in nature, Scythians have heightened senses, and are somewhat lithe and tough.

#### Garrandines

The valleys and coasts are dotted by fiefdoms of a people priding in both their natural athleticism and learnedness. Through their more collectivist outlook, the Garrandines, as these people are known, have managed to rebuild much on the ruins of the old world.

### Elves

Elves are an Elder race that dominated much of the known world before Man’s ascendance. Proud and strong willed, elves have extremely keen senses and graceful dexterity. The elven race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Gray Elves

The noble Gray elves embody the elven ideals of cool intellect, grace and presence of mind. Once the ruling class of glittering cities, the Gray elves now mainly cohabit human settlements, although some islands in the boundless Sea still hold their once-proud, spired castles.

#### Sylvan Elves

In the long years of elven ancestry, the Sylvan elves have become far estranged from their Gray elven kindred. Their isolationist society is brutally martial and values skill with the blade and the bow in combat above all else. The strongholds of these tribal elves are in the deep woods, but many of their kin are found in human lands as well.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are an Elder race as hard and unyielding as the bedrock in which they carve their fortresses. Standing slightly shorter than Men, dwarves are of a sturdy and muscular build and almost invariably wear large beards. The dwarven race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Redbeards (Baraz-tarâg)

The Redbeard dwarf most immediately recognizable is the raucous, boisterous warrior armed to the teeth and clad in heavy armor. Redbeards revel in battle and carnage, but observe their own strict code of honor, making them a common sight in various mercenary companies. The Redbeards are no strangers to human lands, but prefer the fortresses of their Longbeard kin whenever practical.

#### Longbeards (Sigin-tarâg)

Longbeard dwarves share many of the traits of their red-bearded kin, but keep slightly cooler heads on their shoulders, well suited to the fine arts of cogitation and mercantilism. Despite this, these stout dwarves have not forgotten how to wield the axe and hammer. Their many mountainside fortresses, quarries, mines and forges dot the landscape far and wide.

### Gnomes

Gnomes are a curious and ancient Elder race, often mistaken as either young elves or dwarves due to their smaller stature. Their mischievous and humorous nature conceals exceptionally keen cognitive and empathic abilities. Surprisingly resilient and nimble, gnomes are the size of smallish, slender humans and sport a variety of facial hair styles. The gnomish race, like all the Elder races, is in terminal decline due to genetic damage caused by the Glow.

#### Tinkers

While not strictly a separate ethnic group, Tinker gnomes ascribe to a somewhat different philosophy than their Astromancer cousins. They have a mind of machinery and cogwheels, and embrace a more physically adventurous world view. Tinker gnomes are often found in dwarven smitheries and forges, but are well traveled.

#### Astromancers

Astromancer gnomes are those of their kin who have long taken a more spiritual interest in the world. Although they share the mechanical aptitude of their gnomish brethren, they are also fascinated by the deep currents of magic and the divine. These gnomes, rather uniquely, can be found among all of the other cultures &mdash; even the reclusive Sylvan elves &mdash; but also build their own settlements which mix the natural and the technological.

### Life Path

The life path represents the formative years of character development, in abstract terms.

You begin at Place of Origin, and take *ten* rounds representing phases of character development. These phases may each be one year, or some other period of time.

There are four main locales or themes &mdash; Place of Origin, Major City, Adventuring and War. Place of Origin is your home village, neighborhood in a city, or similar place where your earliest development occurs. The City has the most opportunities, but here you will also face competition and may fail in pursuing objectives. Adventuring represents sojourns into the wilderness and faraway lands, and War the many local wars to which any character can either volunteer to or be swept to by Fate.

You can opt to leave to another major locale at each round, but once you leave Place of Origin, it cannot be returned to. At every change of major locale (except War), roll a `d4`. On a `1`, you end up in War instead.

The dark squares are the starting points of each major locale, except War which begins in the dark ellipse labeled War. The squares do not represent actual development, they only act as starting points toward the ellipses. From each node (square or ellipse), you may follow an outbound arrow to pursue that course. If the arrow leads to a blue diamond, you will need to roll a `d4`, and then follow the path whose label contains your roll result. These represent forking points in Fate where your character does not have control over their destiny.

Your choices in following the arrows may represent what your character desires, or you as the player may decide that Fate ordained some path for that characters.

During the life path, there are certain restrictions to bonuses gained.
- Primary stat values may change a maximum of `1` point
- Secondary stat values may change a maximum of `2` points
- Skills may gain a maximum of `5 XP`

## Skills

Most character actions are resolved through the application of skills.

Each skill is governed by a primary stat, whose value is here denoted `P`. The base value of a skill is derived as `P - 10` (can be negative). See [list of skills](#list-of-skills) for a list of which stats govern which skills.

### Skill Resolution

To resolve a skill check, roll a `d20` and add your skill modifier to obtain your roll value `R`. Then compare the roll value to a target difficulty `T`.

If `R > T`, the skill check is successful. Otherwise if `T - R < 5`, the skill check is a partial failure. Otherwise, the skill check is a failure.

The effect of success, partial failure and failure vary from skill to skill.

### Critical Success and Fumble

A natural (i.e. unmodified) `20` is a critical success, and counts as a success, even if the roll value is insufficient, unless otherwise specified.

A natural `1` is a fumble, and counts as a failure, even if the roll value is sufficient.

### Opposed Skill Resolution

Some skill checks are opposed, meaning that two characters directly oppose each other in their skill checks. In such cases, the character with higher roll value succeeds. If both characters roll a fumble or critical success, resolve as if neither had.

On a tie, the "resisting" character wins &mdash; for example, in a Sneaking check, the character who is passively observing.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When you have *advantage*, you roll two `d20`'s for skill checks, and the natural roll value is the higher die result. With *disadvantage*, it's the lower result.

If a dice roll has advantage or disadvantage from multiple sources, it is the same as having single advantage or disadvantage.

If a dice roll has both advantage and disadvantage, it is resolved as if it had neither.

### Skill Target Difficulties

To make gameplay faster, skill check target difficulties are by default limited to a set of predefined target values with standardized names.

| Name | Target | Notes |
|-|-:|-|
| Normal | 10 | Default difficulty. Unskilled character has about 50% success rate.|
| Difficult | 20 | Highly skilled character has about 50% success rate.|
| Extreme | 25 | Natural `20` does not count as critical success.|

### Fatigue in Skill Checks

When a character is *fatigued*, each skill check is further modified by fatigue points. Roll value `R` is `d20` plus skill modifier `S` minus fatigue points `F`.

Combat skills, used during combat, are not subject to fatigue.

### List of Skills

Skills are divided into categories called skillsets. Some skills have associated keywords (e.g. *Melee.*) which can be used as a reference.

## Abilities

*Abilities* are special skills that characters can unlock. An ability becomes available when the total amount of XP spent in that ability's skillset meets the required level and possible prerequisites.

Only one ability may be unlocked per required XP level, so if multiple abilities in the same skillset have the same required level, you must choose which one to acquire.

#### Alarms

When an NPC raises an alarm, other NPCs in the adjacent [areas](time-and-space#local-areas) or designated guard posts will respond.
